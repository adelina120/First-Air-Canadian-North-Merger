# First-Air-Canadian-North-Merger
Research paper for Economics of Antitrust seminar

Canadian North and First Air has been two critical regional airlines to northern 
Canada for goods supply and connecting to larger cities in the south. In 2019, the 
Government of Canada approved a proposed merger between these two airlines for public 
interest considerations despite potential anticompetitive concerns. To evaluate this merger 
and the proclaimed public interests, I collect air movement data and GDP per capita of two 
northern regions, Nunavut and Northwest Territories (NWT), over the past two decades and
conducted a Granger Causality analysis between these two variables. The result shows a 
unidirectional causality from air transport to GDP per capita in NWT, suggesting that 
enhancements in airline service due to the merger could indeed lead to long-term economic 
benefits. Conversely, this causality runs in the opposite direction in Nunavut which may not 
experience direct economic benefits from the merger. However, the region can still be 
advantaged from improved airline qualities given the largely limited road network. Further 
assessment on this merger should incorporate exogenous factors and more specific air 
transport data related to the involved airlines.
